# Company-Employee-Payroll-System

This project supposedly is able to traverse through a tree where the root is the CEO/company head, to department head, to managers, to employees. You would be able to search for employees in multiple ways. Employee ID will generally cout one employee, managers would cout managers of each department, and so forth.  This is supposedly a b-tree or a graph.
